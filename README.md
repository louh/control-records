# Federal Bureau of Control Records Creator

This is a fan project inspired by [Control](https://www.remedygames.com/games/control/), a most excellent game by Remedy Entertainment.

The in-game documents don't look this good, but they're based on the official-looking documents distributed in the press kit edition ([see here for an unboxing video that features them prominently.](
