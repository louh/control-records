## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

Item to be stored in a Black Rock panelled cell. Keep away from lab animals when not in use.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

A simple wicker basket with cloth lining. No food items inside.

The item produces a hypnotic effect that solely affects non-human animals, forcing them to congregate passively around the object. Animals from every genus and species that have thus far been tested are susceptible. Single-cell organisms do not appear to react to the effect.

## APPENDIX:

The exercise unfortunately resulted in ~~xx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx~~ ~~xxxxxxxxxxxxx~~. Further testing should be restricted to more low-risk animal species with medical staff on standby.
