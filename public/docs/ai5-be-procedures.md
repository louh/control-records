## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

The item is a wooden mallet from "High Striker" carnival game. A long wooden handle extends from the head.

The item infects any organic material with an unknown disease upon making physical contact. The effects of this disease are similar to leprosy, but develop at a much faster rate. Within a matter of days, tissue loss develops in the limbs closest to the point of infection. While the disease itself has not claimed any lives, secondary infection has resulted in numerous deaths.
