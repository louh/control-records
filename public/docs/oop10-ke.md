# Songmaster Jukebox (OOP10-KE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

Item is to be kept in a secure location in the Executive Sector (see security order 239-A). The room must be sealed before usage to prevent unintentional transportation of staff.

## DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:

A classic 1950s jukebox, made by Songmaster Entertainment LTD. The jukebox was found with a single record inside, titled "A Song for the Others" by ~~xxxxxx xxxxxx~~.

When this record is played in the object, anyone within earshot is translocated for as long as the album is playing. Those involved in the object's first known incident report being transported to a tropical beach (exact location unknown).

When this object is used in the Oldest House, it only transports users to an area located in the recently-manifested Quarry Threshold. Researchers theorize that this site's unique spatial density results in all transitioning material gravitating to its position, as has been observed with other Bureau equipment. The Oldest House's unique nature could also be having an effect on the object itself.

This object is not bound to any known individual. Attempts by Bureau staff to bind it have resulted in ~~xxxxxx xxxxxxx~~ and should not be attempted again.
