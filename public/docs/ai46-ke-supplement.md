# Pink Flamingo (AI46-KE)

## BACKGROUND:

Agents noticed a transient commonly found outside the entrance of the Bureau headquarters would carry the item and loudly claim to be responsible for the lack of inclement weather. The frequency of these claims attracted the personal interest of Dr. Darling.

In interviews disguised as casual conversations, the transient reported that the item "gives me clouds when it's hot and sun when it's not." An event of note occurred during a heavy downpour when the vagrant was witnessed performing a possible ritual with the item (see file PAI-1372 for a detailed observation). Dr. Darling reported a wait of ~~xxxxx~~ seconds before the rain stopped.

The vagrant was seized the next day. After ~~xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx~~, he was found to possess no ~~xxxxx xxxxxxx~~ and was released. The item remains in Bureau custody under suspicion of altered status, though this still has not been proven. All known variations of Identification Formulas have failed to elicit a response from the item.
