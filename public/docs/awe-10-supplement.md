# Bright Falls (AWE-10)

## DETAILS:

On the day of the flooding, the rock band Old Gods of Asgard was rehearsing in a field outside the Anderson Farm, the homestead of band members Odin and Tor Anderson. Both admitted to being in a heavy state of inebriation at the time, having spent "days" drinking their home-brewed moonshine while celebrating Deerfest.

After the townspeople were evacuated from the flooded field, Sheriff Breaker was asked by Freya Anderson, daughter of Tor Anderson, to check on her father and uncle. Breaker drove to the Anderson Farm and found the band members alive but in need of medical aid. Tor Anderson had been struck by lightning and Odin Anderson had cut out his own right eye (a possible ref. to Norse deities ~~xxxxxxx~~ and ~~xxxxxxx~~?) They claimed the had fought and "valiantly defeated" a "dark army of the scratching hag" rising from Cauldron Lake (see AWE-~~xxx~~ of 1970, related to the suspected ~~xxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx~~ at Diver's Isle).

While impossible to verify, these events are relevant to the recurring AWE at Bright Falls and the Cauldron Lake ~~xxxxxx xxxxxx~~. Odin and Tor Anderson have been listed as persons of interest.
