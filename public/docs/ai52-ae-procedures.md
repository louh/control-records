## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

Item is a yellow rubber duck bath toy from the 1950s. A single hole at the bottom allows air and water to flow in and out.

The item makes a sound analogous to quacking. The item travels considerable distances with surprising speed. How it achieves this motion is unknown. The item forms a ~~xxxxxxxxxxx~~ of unknown purpose with anyone who makes direct physical contact with it and begins to follow them, quacking often. This has led to a researcher named ~~xxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx~~ entering cardiac arrest, though due to the individual's health issues, the matter may not be connected to the item's effect.
