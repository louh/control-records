# Kyiv (AWE-37)

## DETAILS:

Recordings of the audio phenomena were uploaded onto the internet shortly after the event. These records circulated rapidly on popular message boards. The Communications Department utilized this exposure by creating “Sky Trumpet hoax" videos and posting related theories to spread confusion and draw attention away from the event's paranatural origin. Industrial noise, particularly the sound of metal drilling was found to be a widely accepted explanation. Theories about the sounds emanating from the Earth itself, known as Seismic Hum, emerged from the public itself and were encouraged by the Bureau to generate further misdirection and eventual public disinterest.

Witnesses of the event were monitored discretely afterwards. Observed symptoms were consistent with ~~xxxxxxx xxxxxx~~ deprivation, but subsided after 12-15 days. The length of the symptoms directly correlated to the individual's proximity (unsheltered) to the supposed epicenter. One linked, although accidental, casualty can be listed (see report re: the effects of planar friction on hearing aids in file 14-200-1010).
