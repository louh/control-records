# SHÜM Arcade Cabinets (AI40-PE)

## BACKGROUND:

Both items were purchased from a closing arcade in ~~xxxxxxxxxx~~, Michigan as part of a program to improve employee wellbeing through recreation. The program was cancelled before any game machines were dispersed throughout the Oldest House, but not before these Altered Items were discovered.

## SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Teams in the Research Sector have voiced considerable interest in the items due to the fact that they only exhibit an altered effect when physically paired together, a codependent relationship previously unseen in Altered Items (see Research Specialist Pope's paper titled "The Parasensitivity of Sequels" for more information).

However, after proving the items' altered status, the Investigations staff insisted on keeping them, claiming that they are important for sector morale. To date, numerous petitions have been filed by Research Sector personnel to move the items there for more extensive analysis.
